## :pencil: About this project

A Discord bot built with C++ using the D++ library. The primary functionality is creating Discord channels as tasks for tracking purposes. It can be used for more convenient organisation of employees' work on the Discord server. Additionally, the bot includes moderation commands such as `/ban`, `/kick`, and `/timeout`.
